"""Look up a workflow artifact by exact name across ALL workflow runs in a
repo (not just the current run), and download + extract it if found.

`actions/download-artifact` alone can only see artifacts produced earlier in
the *same* run, or (with `run-id:`) a run you already know the ID of. Finding
"whichever baseline artifact happens to be named sca-baseline-<sha>" needs a
name-filtered listing across the whole repo, which only the REST API
provides: GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/artifacts?name=...

Also used, unmodified, by sca-mainline.yml to look up its own rolling
sca-mainline-<branch> artifact - that name isn't SHA-keyed (there's no new
commit to key it by, since a mainline re-scan is triggered by DB drift, not
code change), so more than one same-named artifact can accumulate over time.
select_artifact()'s "newest by created_at" tie-break already does the right
thing there without any change.

Prints "true" or "false" to stdout (nothing else) so a workflow step can do:
  found=$(find_baseline_artifact.py --repo ... --name ... --dest ...)
